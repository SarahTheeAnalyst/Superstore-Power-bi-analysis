# Superstore-Power-bi-analysis
I developed a Power BI project, creating a dashboard, tables, and models to analyse the data.
INSIGHTS: *The west generated the highest amount of sales followed by the east so there should be further investments concentrated in these regions
*There should be maintenance of customer relationship with the first three customers contributing to high sales and other customers can be encouraged to patronize more with good offers.
*Strong sales was achieved even with minimal discounting.
*The number of orders was higher than the number of customers which means that there was repititive purchase.
